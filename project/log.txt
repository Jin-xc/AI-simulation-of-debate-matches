Teacher: 
 Sure! Here's a debate topic and two aspects for the topic:

Aspect 1: Academic Rigor
Aspect 2: Diversity and Inclusion

Student Tony:
 As the first speaker, I argue that universities should prioritize academic rigor over diversity and inclusion. While diversity and inclusion are important values, they must not compromise the academic standards and excellence that universities are meant to uphold. The pursuit of knowledge and critical thinking skills should remain the primary focus of higher education.

Student Jack:

 Sure, here's my response as Student Jack:

I disagree with Tony's assertion that academic rigor and diversity and inclusion are mutually exclusive. In fact, fostering a diverse and inclusive environment on campus actually enhances the academic experience and helps to produce well-rounded graduates who are better equipped to tackle complex challenges in an increasingly globalized world. By prioritizing diversity and inclusion, universities can create a richer learning environment that benefits all students and prepares them for success in a rapidly changing society.

Student Tony:
 Sure, here's my rebuttal to Jack's argument:

While diversity and inclusion are indeed important, they should not be prioritized over academic rigor. Universities have a responsibility to maintain high academic standards and ensure that students are adequately prepared for their future careers. In contrast, promoting diversity and inclusion may lead to a watered-down curriculum that compromises the quality of education.

Student Jack:
 Sure, I'd be happy to continue the debate. Here's my next statement:

Universities can actually achieve both academic rigor and diversity and inclusion by creating an inclusive environment that fosters diverse perspectives and ideas, which ultimately enriches the academic experience and produces more well-rounded graduates. In fact, studies have shown that diverse classrooms lead to better academic outcomes, including higher grades and increased graduation rates.

Now it's your turn again, Student Tony. Please provide your rebuttal.

Student Tony:
 Sure, here's my rebuttal to Jack's argument:

While diversity and inclusion are important, they should not come at the expense of academic rigor. Universities must maintain high academic standards to ensure that students are adequately prepared for their future careers. Promoting diversity and inclusion may lead to a watered-down curriculum that compromises the quality of education.

Furthermore, academic rigor and diversity and inclusion are not mutually exclusive. Universities can achieve both by creating an inclusive environment that fosters diverse perspectives and ideas, which ultimately enriches the academic experience and produces more well-rounded graduates. Studies have shown that diverse classrooms lead to better academic outcomes, including higher grades and increased graduation rates.

Teacher:
 As the teacher, I would like to commend both students for their excellent participation in today's debate. Both Tony and Jack presented well-reasoned arguments and counterarguments, demonstrating their ability to think critically and articulate their thoughts clearly. However, based on the quality of their arguments, delivery, and overall performance, I would give the following ratings:

Tony: 4/5

* Strengths: Tony presented a clear and concise opening statement, effectively setting the stage for the rest of the debate. He also provided strong rebuttals to Jack's arguments, highlighting potential weaknesses in his opponent's reasoning. Additionally, Tony demonstrated good use of evidence and examples to support his claims.
* Weaknesses: At times, Tony's responses seemed a bit scripted, lacking the natural flow of a spontaneous argument. Furthermore, some of his rebuttals could have been more nuanced, acknowledging the validity of Jack's points while still refuting them.

Jack: 4.5/5

* Strengths: Jack offered a compelling counterargument to Tony's opening statement, effectively emphasizing the importance of diversity and inclusion in academia. He also displayed a strong command of the topic, seamlessly incorporating relevant evidence and statistics into his arguments. Moreover, Jack showed great adaptability, quickly responding to Tony's rebuttals with thoughtful counterpoints.
* Weaknesses: Occasionally, Jack's delivery seemed slightly hesitant or uncertain, potentially diluting the impact of his otherwise robust arguments. Also, some of his transitions between arguments could have been smoother, creating a more cohesive narrative throughout the debate.

Overall, both students performed admirably, showcasing their intellectual abilities and communication skills. With further practice and refinement, they will undoubtedly become even stronger debaters.
