Student Tony:
 As the student Tony, I believe that universities should prioritize academic rigor over diversity and inclusion. While diversity and inclusion are important values, they should not come at the expense of academic excellence. The primary purpose of a university is to provide students with a challenging and rigorous education that prepares them for their future careers, and compromising on academic standards would undermine the value of a university degree.

Student Jack:
 Sure, here's my opening statement as student Jack:

 Universities should prioritize both academic rigor and diversity and inclusion. While academic rigor is essential for preparing students for their future careers, diversity and inclusion are critical for fostering a diverse and inclusive community that promotes creativity, innovation, and social responsibility. By balancing these two aspects, universities can create a learning environment that challenges students to think critically, engage with different perspectives, and develop into well-rounded individuals who are prepared to succeed in an increasingly complex world.

Student Tony:
 Sure, I'll continue the debate.

 As the student Tony, I argue that academic rigor should be the top priority of universities, as it ensures that students receive a high-quality education that prepares them for their future careers. Compromising on academic standards would dilute the value of a university degree and ultimately harm students' career prospects.

 On the other hand, Student Jack's emphasis on diversity and inclusion is misguided, as it suggests that academic rigor and diversity are mutually exclusive goals. In reality, universities can promote both academic excellence and diversity by implementing policies that support underrepresented groups without sacrificing academic standards.

Student Jack:
 As the student Jack, I argue that universities can strike a balance between academic rigor and diversity and inclusion, and that doing so is essential for creating a well-rounded education that prepares students for success in today's diverse and rapidly changing world. By promoting diversity and inclusion, universities can foster a learning environment that challenges students to think critically and engage with different perspectives, while still maintaining high academic standards.

Teacher:
 Sure! Here are my ratings and feedback for each student:

Student Tony:

* Content: 4/5 - Tony has presented a clear and concise argument in favor of academic rigor. He has provided several convincing points and has shown a good understanding of the topic. However, his arguments could benefit from more nuance and depth.
* Delivery: 3/5 - Tony speaks clearly and confidently, but his delivery could benefit from more energy and passion. At times, he sounds a bit monotonous and lacks conviction.
* Overall: 3.5/5 - While Tony has presented a solid argument, he could improve by addressing counterarguments and providing more concrete examples to support his claims.

Student Jack:

* Content: 4.5/5 - Jack has presented a strong argument in favor of diversity and inclusion. He has provided several compelling points and has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic. His argument is well-structured and easy to follow.
* Delivery: 4/5 - Jack speaks confidently and with conviction. He uses appropriate body language and vocal inflections to emphasize his points.
* Overall: 4.25/5 - Jack has presented an excellent argument, but could improve by anticipating counterarguments and providing more specific examples to support his claims.

Overall, both students have done a great job in presenting their arguments and engaging with each other's perspectives. With some minor adjustments, they could further strengthen their arguments and deliver them more effectively.
