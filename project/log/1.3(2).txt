Teacher: 
 Sure! Here's a debate topic and two aspects for the topic:
 Topic: "The Impact of Social Media on Society"

 Aspect 1: "Social media has had a positive impact on society by fostering global communication and connection."
 Aspect 2: "Social media has had a negative impact on society by promoting superficiality and decreasing face-to-face interaction."

Student Tony: 
 As the first speaker, I argue that social media has had a positive impact on society by fostering global communication and connection, allowing people to access information and share ideas across borders and cultures.

Student Jack: 
 Sure, here's my argument against Tony's point: While social media has enabled global communication and connection, it has also created echo chambers and amplified hate speech, leading to a decline in meaningful, face-to-face interactions and an increase in polarization and divisiveness.

Student Tony: 
 I disagree with Jack's assertion that social media has created echo chambers and amplified hate speech, as studies have shown that social media platforms can actually help to bridge geographical and political divides, and promote diverse perspectives and inclusive online discussions.

Student Jack: 
 Sure, here's my rebuttal to Tony's argument: While social media has the potential to bridge geographical and political divides, its algorithms often prioritize sensational content over nuanced discussion, leading to the amplification of extreme views and the marginalization of moderate voices.

Teacher: 
 As the teacher, I will provide ratings and feedback for each student based on their performance during the debate.

 For Student Tony:
 
 * Content: 4/5 - Tony presented some good points about the positive impact of social media on society, such as fostering global communication and connection. However, he could have provided more specific examples and evidence to support his arguments.
 * Delivery: 3/5 - Tony spoke clearly and confidently, but he could have used more inflection and vocal variety to keep the audience engaged.
 * Rebuttal: 4/5 - Tony did a good job of addressing Jack's points and providing counterarguments, but he could have done a better job of refuting Jack's assertions with more concrete evidence.
 
 Overall, Tony scored 11/15.
 
 For Student Jack:
 
 * Content: 4/5 - Jack raised several valid points about the negative impact of social media on society, such as creating echo chambers and amplifying hate speech. However, he could have provided more nuanced arguments and considered alternative perspectives.
 * Delivery: 3/5 - Jack spoke clearly and with conviction, but he could have used more body language and vocal inflections to convey his message more effectively.
 * Rebuttal: 4/5 - Jack did a good job of challenging Tony's points and providing counterarguments, but he could have done a better job of anticipating Tony's rebuttals and addressing them proactively.
 
 Overall, Jack scored 11/15.
 
 Based on these scores, it seems that both students performed well in the debate, but there is room for improvement in terms of providing more specific examples and evidence, using more effective delivery techniques, and anticipating and addressing counterarguments.
